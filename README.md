# CSC207 Course Project UNU

## Software Specification

Our computer program allows a user to play UNO against bots. The program deals cards to players and users can either play valid cards from their hand or draw cards from the deck during their turns. Certain cards have special effects on the game.

Users can choose:

- The difficulty of their opponents

- To play in teams

The program also records player statistics.
